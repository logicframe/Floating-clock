# Floating-clock
Just a floating clock, shows current time. What else to say?

By default it's dark purple. As my experience has shown, this is an excellent color, clock was always visible.

**So, how to use:**
launch the clock
drag it(you have to hover your mouse directly over clock, not on the gaps between numbers)  to whatever place you want to

To close the clock, just close the consome(cmd).

Uses about 20 megabytes of RAM. May need less if you have Python installed(as for me it was 16 megabytes)

# NOTE:
If you runned the clock in PyCharm and then closed ONLY Pycharm(without stopping the code), to close the clock now you have to use Task Manager. 

1. Search for "Python" process

2. end it.
